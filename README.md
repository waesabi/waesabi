👨‍🎓 Computer Science & Engineer from NIT Durgapur

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about open-source community. Some technologies I enjoy working with Swift, NodeJs and MongoDB.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Online Coding Judge API using NodeJs and MongoDB.

```Swift 
let aboutMe = {
    return [
        "askMyAbout": [
            "iOS Dev",
            "tech",
            "music",
            "anime"
        ],
        "technologies": [
            "languages": ["Java","Swift","C++","JavaScript"],
            "Mobile": ["iOS","Android"],
            "backEnd": ["NodeJs"],
